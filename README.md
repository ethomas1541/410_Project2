2. Dot product is used in determining the transparency of the "sight cone", which is opaque if the player approaches head-on, invisible if player is orthogonal or behind
3. Lerp is used to choose a color between green (safe) and red (danger) as the player approaches the ghost
4. Particles are exclamation marks. Emission rate changes based on a composite between facing angle and distance to enemy
   Particles have gravity, size-over-time and color-over-time modifiers for better immersion
5. Sound effects are... well... kind of obvious once you get close to the ghosts...
   Apologies in advance

Game over screen and sound changed to better complement my, uh... "liberties" taken with... the sound design...
